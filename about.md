Footsies is a podcast created by [Foot Cardigan](http://www.footcardigan.com) co-founders Bryan DeLuca and Matt McClard. Sometimes they talk about making socks and business-y things. Sometimes it might get real weird. One thing is certain: Nothing is certain. Mmmm, deep. 

You can find Bryan and Matt clogging up the internet tubes on Twitter at [@bryamdeluca](https://twitter.com/bryandeluca) and [@yankeyhotel](https://twitter.com/yankeyhotel). And if you need to contact us there is thing called email, trust me it's super handy and you can reach us at [podcast@footsiespodcast.com](mailto:podcast@footsiespodcast.com).
