subtitle: "Oh hey, we’re back. Don’t hate us for the hi-ate-us. See what we did there? Bryan and Matt prove that podcasting is, in fact, not like riding a bike at all. They discuss the fine art of furnishing their new office space and what their calculated hiring process is like over at Foot Cardigan."

Yay. Footsies made it six whole episodes. We’re like professionals or not or something. In this episode,  Bryan and Matt talk about holiday time as an e-commerce/retailer/online business/whatever Foot Cardigan is. If this episode doesn’t make sense, it’s probably because we’re drowning in whatever the eggnog version of being an e-commerce company in December is.
